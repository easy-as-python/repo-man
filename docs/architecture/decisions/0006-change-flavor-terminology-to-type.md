# 6. Change flavor terminology to type

Date: 2024-02-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The "flavor" terminology is a bit too playful and perhaps unfamiliar to people of some backgrounds.
The word "type," while possibly a bit generic, is more aligned with colloquial discussion about repositories.

## Decision

Change the word "flavor" to "type" wherever applicable.

## Consequences

- People might better understand what this tool does
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the new terminology
- Commands like `flavors` need to change, and will break usage as a result
